# ðŸŒ‹ vulkan-raytracing ðŸ––

* "Simple" Vulkan raytracing demo based on __VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline__ + __VK_KHR_acceleration_structure__ extensions.
* Highlights: setup of ray tracing pipeline, example of how to use ray differentials for texture filtering.

Prerequisites:
* Microsoft Visual Studio  
<sub> Provided solution is for VS2017. For VS2019/VS2022/VS2033 confirm toolset upgrade request when opening the solution for the first time.</sub>
* Vulkan SDK  
<sub>To get access to the shader compiler.</sub>

Build steps: 

1. Open solution in Visual Studio IDE.
2. Find F7 key on the keyboard and press it firmly.

_"About 128KB of source code is a reasonable upper limit for the complexity of single triangle ray tracing problems now envisioned."_
